        Lorem <span class="c">Ipsum</span> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the <span class="c">leap</span> into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum <span class="y">passages</span>, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
