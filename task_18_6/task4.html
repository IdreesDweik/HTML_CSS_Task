        <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an
            empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but
            he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few
            things in the box.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Jack would really like...</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
            <li>A motorized lego set</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy
            store. Two very popular ones are <a href="#">toysrus.com</a> and
            <a href="#">eTOYS</a>.
